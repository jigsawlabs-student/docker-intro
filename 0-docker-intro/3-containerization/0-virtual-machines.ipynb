    "2. The Kernel\n",
    "    *  A kernel is a running software process in charge of making physical changes to our computer (eg. like our hard drive)\n",
    "    * So for example, if we save a in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Word does not directly save the file to our hard drive, but rather asks the kernel to do so.\n",
    "   \n",
    "> **Kernels.  But why?**  Computers use kernels to make changes so that a kernel can prevent multiple programs from trying to alter the same parts of our computer at the same time.  Now with virtual machines, this becomes a problem as each virtual machine along with the host machine each has a separate kernel.  So there is actually a hypervisor that is the gateway between all of these kernels and the actual computer hardware.  "

Each time  we want an isolated environment we need a separate computing operating system with each operating system having a separate kernel.  Each operating system and kernel takes up space.  And starting up a new operating system takes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while it would be great if we could have software running in it's own isolated environment that was easily reproducible, to do so the time and space requirements would of an isolated environment would need to decrease.  That's the promise of Docker: create an isolated environment while limiting the speed and space requirements of each environment. "

    "In this lesson, we learned of a predecessor to containerization with virtual machines.  Virtuals helped to meet the need of creating an isolated and reproducible computing environment.  We learned that each virtual machine had it's own operating system with it's own kernel in charge of making changes to a computer's hardware.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that one of the downsides of a virtual machine is that creating a separate operating system prevents creating a new environment from being a lightweight process.  Creating a new environment requires both time to bootup the environment and space run and store the system.  Containers seek to provide the benefits of isolation while being lightweight. "
