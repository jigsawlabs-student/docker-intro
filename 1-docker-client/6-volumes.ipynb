    "The main way that we distinguish volumes from bind mounts is that volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem that Docker manages (on Linux, in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`).  By contrast, bind mounts, can be stored in any folder on the host system.  And with bind mounts, non-Docker processes can modify the files in the mounted folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "So volumes exist strictly within the Docker universe while bind mounts do not.  The recommended to practice is to try to use volumes.  Volumes will make it easier to deploy our data to the cloud and come with other docker features like encryption of our data.  So for example, it probably makes sense to store data from a database in a volume.  We can always connect that data to a docker container, and then deploy that data to a cloud service like AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something like a jupyter notebook however, may not be a great use case for volumes, as we don't always need/want to use them inside of a docker container.  So instead we may choose bind mounts.  It is a judgment call, but as we become more comfortable with docker, we will likely lean on volumes more to keep our data within the docker universe."
