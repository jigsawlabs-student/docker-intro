We saw this in the context of a blogging platform, Ghost.  And this seems odd, because if we have a blog, and we write a nice article, we don't want our blog posts to simply be destroyed if we need to shut down the website.\n",

This way, the contents won't be read and written inside of the container, but they will be read and written on a folder in our host, which is not so temporary.  Ok, let's do it."

So, for example, with Jupyter, we can simply use a different Jupyter container or image to begin using our data.  Perhaps we have csv data that we want to use in with a Jupyter image sometime, and a database, a la postgres, other times.  We could use bind mounting to connect data on our local machine to a postgres containers sometimes and a jupyter contain when we prefer to use Jupyter."
